## 🌍 Mission: Transforming AI's Cognitive Horizon

Focus is not just a research project—it's a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence. By reimagining attention mechanisms through the lens of human cognitive focus, we're pushing the boundaries of what neural networks can achieve.

### 🚀 Breakthrough Highlights

- **+14.06%** Accuracy improvement over traditional attention
- **+16.69%** F1 Score gain across benchmarks
- **+23.93%** Recall Enhancement in challenging datasets
- **Unprecedented Interpretability**: Visualize AI's thought process

## 🧠 The Science Behind Focus

Our mechanism draws inspiration from two revolutionary concepts:
1. **Camera Optics**: Dynamic focusing of visual information
2. **Human Cognition**: Selective attention and context understanding

### 🌟 Key Innovations

- **Adaptive Focus**: Dynamically adjusts attention based on content relevance
- **Gaussian Window**: Introduces smooth, probabilistic attention distributions
- **Multi-Head Architecture**: Captures diverse input sequence aspects
- **Efficient Implementation**: Optimized for training and inference

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

The Focus Mechanism revolutionizes attention through:
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Parallel processing of input sequences
- **Gaussian Focus Window**: Dynamic attention concentration
- **Adaptive Weighting**: Content-aware focus adjustment

## 💡 Quick Start

```python
from focus.models import FocusLSTM

# Initialize the model with automatic focus
model = FocusLSTM(
    vocab_size=30000,
    hidden_dim=256,
    n_layers=2,
    n_heads=4
)

# Forward pass with intelligent focusing
outputs, attention = model(input_ids, attention_mask)
```
