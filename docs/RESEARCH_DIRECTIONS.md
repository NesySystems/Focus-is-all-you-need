## Research Directions

While the Focus Mechanism already demonstrates improved performance and interpretability in sequence tasks, there remain many exciting avenues for further exploration:

## 1. Transformer Integration
- **Replacing Self-Attention**: Swap out standard multi-head attention for lens-based heads in a Transformer block.
- **Parallel Lenses**: Multiple lens centers could be learned for different heads, potentially capturing multiple focal regions.

## 2. Iterative / Multi-Step Focusing
- **Saccadic Moves**: Inspired by human eye movements, focus could shift sequentially over tokens or patches, refining context each step.
- **Recurrent Gating**: A small RNN or gating mechanism could re-compute μ and σ after each partial read.

## 3. Multi-Modal & 2D Focusing
- **Vision**: Directly apply lens weighting to image patches or CNN feature maps. 
- **Audio**: Sharpen temporal frames in speech recognition, highlight critical pitch or energy peaks.

## 4. Theoretical Analysis
- **Robustness**: Investigate whether lens distributions help handle noisy or adversarial inputs. 
- **Convergence**: Study the lens parameter learning dynamics (e.g., how quickly μ, σ converge).

## 5. Memory & Efficiency Optimizations
- **Sparse Implementations**: Possibly skip computing attention for tokens far from μ or outside a certain σ radius, saving compute resources.
- **Compression Techniques**: Explore quantization or pruning for lens weights.

## 6. Human-Level Interpretability
- **Explaining Predictions**: The lens map could become a prime interpretability tool, akin to saliency methods. 
- **User Feedback**: In interactive systems, users might adjust or correct the lens center, guiding model attention.
