# Technical Overview of Focus Mechanism

## Architecture Components

### 1. Input Sequence Processing
- Handles variable-length sequential data
- Supports multiple input modalities
- Robust preprocessing and normalization

### 2. Embedding Layer
- Transforms raw input into dense vector representations
- Supports:
  - Word embeddings
  - Numeric feature embeddings
  - Multi-modal embedding strategies

### 3. Bidirectional LSTM
- Captures contextual information from both past and future
- Mitigates vanishing gradient problem
- Enables rich, contextual feature extraction

### 4. Focus Mechanism Components

#### Query, Key, Value Heads
- Dynamically generate context-aware representations
- Probabilistic mapping of information relevance
- Adaptive weighting of input features

#### Gaussian Distribution Heads
- μ (Mean) Head: Determines focal point
- σ (Variance) Head: Controls focus spread
- Enables soft, probabilistic attention

### 5. Focus Attention
- Combines probabilistic focus with weighted information
- Produces context-sensitive output
- Adaptable across different problem domains

## Mathematical Formulation

### Focus Distribution
```
P(x | μ, σ) = (1 / (σ * √(2π))) * exp(-(x - μ)² / (2σ²))
```

### Attention Weights
```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax((Q * K^T) / √d_k) * V
```
